                <p>This mission was a monumental achievement in both human space exploration and human history.
                    Achieving President John F. Kennedy's goal, and significantly advancing scientific understanding of the moon.</p>
                    
                    <p>Although the astronauts became the face and imagery of the landing, and rightly so, at its peak,
                    400,000 people worked on this mission. Without their sacrifices, knowledge and determination,
                    the world as we know it may have looked vastly different.</p>
                    
                    <p>So as you look through this historical
                    document and visit the gallery pages, share a thought for those working behind the scenes, who
